                    "One of the most valuable tools available to a trader is not some fancy 
                    market indicator or some sexy trading technique, but a simple, yet effective 
                    diary of losing trades. I have found that keeping a log of all my losses 
                    makes it easier for me to spot trends and recurring mistakes and errors."

            <p>
                Talk to any successful day trader and you'll hear a similar story. As important 
                as it is to divine patterns from charts, it is likely even more important to 
                record and analyze your trades in order to discover patterns in <em>your own trading 
                behavior</em>. While overall trading activity moves quickly to capitalize on market 
                opportunities, the individual trader relies only on himself to identify strengths 
                and weaknesses in his own performance; winners and losers in the history of his 
                own day to day transactions. And this requires careful record keeping.

                    "If you do not have good records, how can you measure your performance, rate your 
                    progress, and learn from your mistakes? Those who do not learn from the past are 
                    doomed to repeat it."

                But therein lies the rub. While every trader knows the importance of maintaining 
                a trade log, most find the task of manually recording the details of every trade 
                just too burdensome and time consuming. Even for those who meticulously log a 
                history of trades, few are able to discern the patterns in hundreds or thousands 
                of trades that will prepare them to improve their performance when the bell rings 
                the next day.
